<p><em>16 matches, 635 runs and high score of 101* in the 2021 edition of the league, Ruturaj Gaikwad was retained by the CSK ahead of the 2022 edition of the league for INR 6 crore. The opening batter who hails from Pune, Ruturaj Gaikwad has been a consistent performer for his state team Maharashtra. He was the highest run-getter for Maharashtra in the league stage of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2018-19. At the IPL 2019 Player Auction, the Chennai Super Kings secured his services at his base price of INR 20 lacs. He has been their most consistent opener and will look to do the same come April and May.</emp></p>
